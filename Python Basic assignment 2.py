4.What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

Answer: 
-->(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
(5 > 4) is True and (3 == 5) is False, so
True and False evaluates to FALSE.

-->not (5 > 4)
This is TRUE.

-->(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
(5 > 4) is True and (3 == 5) is false
True or False evaluates to TRUE.

-->not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(5 > 4) is True and (3 == 5) is False, so
(True or False) is True and
not True evaluates to FALSE. 

-->(True and True) and (True == False)
True and True is True
True == False is False
True and False evaluates to FALSE.

-->(not False) or (not True)
not False is True
not True is False
True or False evaluates to TRUE.

6.How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
Answer: The equal to operator is used by writing "==" and the assignment operator is used by writing "=".

#Example for equal to operator
x = 5
y = 10
if x == y:
    print("x is equal to y")

iteration and jumps to the next iteration of the loop.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Answer: range(10):

This form of range() generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 (inclusive) up to, but not 
including, the specified number (10 in this case).

range(0, 10):
This form of range() generates a sequence of numbers starting from the first argument (0 in this case) 
up to, but not including, the second argument (10 in this case).

range(0, 10, 1):
This form of range() generates a sequence of numbers starting from the first argument (0 in this case)
up to, but not including, the second argument (10 in this case), with the specified step value 
(1 in this case).
